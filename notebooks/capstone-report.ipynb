    "Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process to transform text images to text in a computer format, giving us information in an unstructured way, so is necessary to classify this data to gain knowledge about them to have better document retrieval. The Tradeshift company make on that foundation a machine learning based product to classify the text blocks in a document to some labels like dates, address, and names to enrich the data of the OCR process. This organization resolves to host a competition on Kaggle, a data science platform, opening their data for community try to beat their machine learning model to the classification problem. The competition can be access through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tradeshift-text-classification) and is available to the Kaggle community who intends to beat their benchmark like me.\n",
